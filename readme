# 1. Benefits for Annotations:

## Python Shorthands that make reading documentation easy
- Type the function name Func() then within the parenthesis hit: Shift + Tab to show discription of Function
- Type Func? then hit Shift + Enter to show parameters of Function
- Type Func?? then hit Shift + Enter to show entire Documentation and Function Code

# Default Neural Oscillation Frequency bands from literature (WIkipedia)
## Brain waves
- Delta wave – (0.2 – 3 Hz)
- Theta wave – (4 – 7 Hz)
- Alpha wave – (8 – 13 Hz)
- Mu wave – (7.5 – 12.5 Hz)
- SMR wave – (12.5 – 15.5 Hz)
- Beta wave – (16 – 31 Hz)
- Gamma wave – (32 – 100 Hz)

#### Others: delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz),low gamma (30–70 Hz), and high gamma (70–150 Hz)


For Class Pre-Processing:

The Processing Functions all follow the same general Steps:
    - [1] Validate proper steps have been made and Necessary Object Instances exist
        - [1.1] Check Pipeline is still Open
        - [1.2] Check Dependencies Exist
    - [2] Back-up Neural Data in case of Mistake [Make_Backup(self)]
    - [3] Do User Specified Processing on Song Neural Data
    - [4] Do User Specified Processing on Silence Neural Data
    - [5] Update the Process Log with User Defined Steps (Done Last Incase of Error)
